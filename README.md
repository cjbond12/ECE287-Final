Tested on Cyclone V FPGA

Goal: Produce a Mandelbrot Set Fractal generated in the FPGA Board and displayed to the monitor via a VGA cable

A Fractal is a graph that endlessly generates the same pattern over and over again while expanding or zooming out. 
Think of a triangle that is made of 3 smaller triangles that are themselves made of 3 smaller triangles. 
This pattern continues for ever. 

The Mandelbrot Set is one of the most reconizable fractal disigns and the one we choose to repilcate on the FPGA.
We sourced our design from a github what was written in SV (System Verilog) and converted it into verilog.
We had to debug issues converting the original code into verilog as SV has many function that verilog does not have. 
We also ran into issues where random or messed up images were displayed. These were often very interesting and would make some nice backgrounds.

This was from messing with the VGA output and what was actually being sent

The Eye of Sauron! This happened because we were messing with the algorithem calculations

List of switches and which ones zoom in and out and move the image left, right, up, and down:

Zoom: 
SW[0]- Zoom in by factor of 2X
SW[1]- Zoom in by factor of 4X
SW[2]- Zoom in by factor of 8X

Horizontal Shift:
SW[3]- Shift Image left by factor of 2X
SW[4]- Shift Image left by factor of 4X
SW[5]- Shift Image left by factor of 8X

Vertical Shift:
SW[6]- Shift Image up by factor of 2X
SW[7]- Shift Image up by factor of 4X
SW[8]- Shift Image up by factor of 8X

This is a zoomed in version of the Mandlebrot that is centered on the monitor by using the switches
